<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Am√©lie (any pronouns).</h1>

# About me

I am an 18 year old French graphics programmer. I mostly enjoy API work but I'm currently learning modern rendering techniques, light transport and advanced GPU driven rendering.
I am currently getting a BSc in game development at Gaming Campus.

My passion for video games, art and my natural curiosity makes me constantly motivated to learn more ways to render beautiful interactive experiences in real-time.
Some of my biggest inspirations include The Witness, Death Stranding, Silent Hill 3, Yakuza : Like a Dragon, Astro Bot and Half-Life 2.

I am fluent in both English and French, currently perfecting my Spanish and willing to learn a new language to open up my professional network.

# Job inquiries

For any job inquiries (internships or full-time offers), feel free to contact me through e-mail at amelie.heinrich.dev@gmail.com. I am always looking for more experience in the games industry, even more in AAA. I am open to work anywhere in the European Union or other countries that allow me to work there without needing a VISA (Norway, for instance).

# Professional experience

I was able to work on Quantic Dream's rendering engine through an internship I was able to do during July-December 2023.
