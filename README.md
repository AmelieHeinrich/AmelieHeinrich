# 👩🏻‍💻 About Me

💡 French graphics programmer.\
🎓 I'm currently studying game development at the G. Tech university in Paris.\
✍️ In my free time, I enjoy playing games.\
👩🏻‍💻 I like core game engine programming, graphics programming, shader art, and making apps and games for consoles.\
💡 My favorite languages are C and C++, but I have experiences in other low level languages, like Odin and a bit of Zig.\
🛠 I have experience with technologies like DirectX 11 and 12, Vulkan, OpenGL, as well as console development such as the PS5.

# 🛠 Games I've worked on

I was able to work on Quantic Dream's rendering engine through an internship I was able to do during July-December 2023.

# 🛠 My current personal project, Oni

Oni is an experimental D3D12 renderer where I'm trying to implement as much state of the art rendering techniques as possible.
