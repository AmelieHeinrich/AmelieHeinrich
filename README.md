<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Amélie (he/him).</h1>

# About me

I am a French graphics programmer. I mostly enjoy API and engine work but I'm currently learning modern rendering techniques, light transport and advanced GPU driven rendering.
I am currently getting a BSc in game development at Gaming Campus.

My passion for video games, art and my natural curiosity makes me constantly motivated to learn more ways to render beautiful interactive experiences in real-time.
Some of my biggest inspirations include Death Stranding, Silent Hill 3, Half-Life 2 and Cry of Fear.

I am fluent in both English and French (native language), currently learning Norwegian (B1).

# Job inquiries

For any job inquiries (internships or full-time offers), feel free to contact me through e-mail at amelie.heinrich.dev@gmail.com. I am always looking for more experience in the games industry, even more in AAA. I am open to relocate everywhere in the world.

# What are you working on?

My current main project is [Kaleidoscope](https://github.com/Floating-Trees-Inc/Kaleidoscope) and [Seraph](https://github.com/AmelieHeinrich/Seraph), the first being a full blown game engine and the other one being a showcase renderer using that engine.

# Professional experience

During the summer of 2025 (May-September), I had the opportunity to work as a Graphics Programmer intern on the [Snowdrop](https://www.massive.se/project/snowdrop-engine/) engine in Ubisoft Montpellier, working on an unnanounced game project.

I was able to work on Quantic Dream's rendering engine through an internship I was able to do during July-December 2023.
