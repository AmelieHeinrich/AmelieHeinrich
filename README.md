## About me

I am a 19 year old French graphics & ML programmer focusing on advancements in real-time rendering using modern GPU technology like raytracing, machine learning and more.
My skills vary from graphics API/platform development on all major desktop and console platforms to modern rendering techniques, whether analytical or neural.

My passion for video games and arts make me naturally motivated to research more ways to render beautiful experiences in real-time. Some of my biggest inspirations include Death Stranding 2, Silent Hill 3 and Ghost of Tsushima.

Français/English OK, 日本語/Norsk studying
